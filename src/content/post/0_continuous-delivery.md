Continuous Delivery is a domain that encompasses a wealth of theoretical discourse. The landscape is abundant with conceptual frameworks and academic discussions describing best practices and implementation approaches. However, despite the wealth of theoretical knowledge, most organizations struggle to transform this knowledge into practical implementation.

The challenge often arises due to the tendency to treat Continuous Delivery as an ancillary consideration, frequently becoming a post-development endeavour. The modern organisation needs to transition towards a paradigm where application or service development, and Continuous Delivery, are interdependent, coexisting harmoniously. This implies that the one should not exist without the other, which means they need to be built concurrently.

Living organisms possess the ability to sense changes in their environment and promptly adapt to them. This agility is essential for their sustained health and overall resilience. Similarly, applications and services should also be seen as dynamic entities, living within an interconnected ecosystem, constantly adapting to the ever-changing environment. They need to constantly undergo an evolutionary process, ensuring their ongoing suitability and effectiveness.

Similarly, we need to think of our applications and services as living, where they constantly need to adapt and evolve to the fast-chainging environment within which they live. Thinking about our applications and services this way, helps us build applicaitons and services that not only meet their intended purpose, but also exhibit resilience and adaptability in the face of constantly evolving requirements.
